# Smart-WAIting
AI model that can predict how match long should take doctor visit time

In many cases, patients arrive for their scheduled doctor appointments only to find themselves waiting for half an hour or more for an eight-minute consultation. â€¦
Not only that these delays prevent patients from entering their appointments on time, but they also cause them to miss significant activities planned for afterward. 

This situation leads to considerable frustration and wasted time for them as well  for the medical staff.

SmartWAIting  was developed to address this problem. 
By analyzing medical records, patient age, and the purpose of the visit, the system can accurately predict how much long should the visit take.

This helps reduce waiting times, streamline doctors' schedules, and enhance the patient experience. 
With SmartWAIting , patients can better plan their day and minimize the negative impact of delays on their lives.
